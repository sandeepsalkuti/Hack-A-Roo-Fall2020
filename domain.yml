  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: "Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
        and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
        can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS,
        and COVID-19.

  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: "This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The\
        \ first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now\
        \ spreading from person-to-person.

  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: "Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
          of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
          to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
          safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
          or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: "It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
          COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
          cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
          these viruses during other months.

  utter_high_risk:
